DMS - App
Application Overview & Users
    • Primary objective defined as creating an application and admin panel for DMS to manage daily routine tasks assigned to technicians.
    • User roles identified: Admin (full control), Engineers (senior staff who assign jobs), Technicians (receive job assignments), Customers (job owners) – clarifying that customers will not have app access, and Job Coordinator (manages job distribution).
    • Subcontractors (plumbers, electricians) will not have app access - for DMS employees only.
Current Job Management Workflow
    • Job creation process: Jobs come in via phone calls or emails to coordinator/engineers.
    • Job assignment depends on job complexity - coordinator assigns simple jobs, engineers handle complex ones requiring oversight.
    • Daily prioritization: Previous day's incomplete jobs take priority, followed by emergency calls (hotels without water get immediate priority).

    • Approval processes: Office staff sign requisitions, engineers/coordinators approve purchase orders. (some office staff can also issue purchase orders).
Job Status Management
    • Rescheduling scenarios: When jobs cannot be completed due to external factors, technicians contact engineer/coordinator for rescheduling.
    • Workshop transfers: Some items require removal to workshop for repair assessment.
    • Escalation mechanism: Jobs not completed within three days should be automatically escalated.
    • Cancellation policy: Only customers can cancel jobs, sometimes resulting in call-out fees.
Billing & Invoice Process
    • Invoice triggers: Jobs must be completed and customer-signed before billing begins.
    • Deposit requirements: Large jobs require 60% deposits, configurable per job.
    • Approval workflow: Billing coordinator compiles invoices, engineers review for accuracy, then sent to clients.
    • Subcontractor billing: External contractor invoices included in final client billing.
QuickBooks Integration Requirements

    • Dual file structure: Separate QuickBooks files for inventory management and accounting/invoicing.
